                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">FindMate is a community-based platform designed to help people find their lost belongings. Users can post a report for a lost item or a found item. Others can then browse these reports to help connect owners with their property.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Is FindMate free to use?</h3>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Yes, FindMate is completely free for all users to post and browse reports. Our goal is to help the community, and we do not charge any fees for our service.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">What should I do if I lose something?</h3>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">If you've lost an item, the first thing you should do is create a "Lost Item Report." Click on the "Report Lost Item" link in the navigation bar, fill in as many details as you can (a photo is very helpful!), and submit the form. Your report will then be visible to others in the "Lost Items" section.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">What should I do if I find something?</h3>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">If you find a lost item, you can help reunite it with its owner by creating a "Found Item Report." Click on "Report Found Item," describe the item you found, where you found it, and provide your contact details so the owner can get in touch with you.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Is my personal information safe?</h3>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">We take your privacy seriously. The contact information you provide (name, email, phone) is only displayed on the specific item report you create, so that finders or owners can contact you. We recommend meeting in a safe, public place to exchange items.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">How do I delete my report after I get my item back?</h3>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Currently, only administrators can delete item reports to ensure the integrity of the listings. If your item has been returned, you can use the "Contact Us" page, and an admin will remove your report from the public view.</p>
